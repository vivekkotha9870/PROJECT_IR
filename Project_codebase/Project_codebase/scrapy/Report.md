**Abstract**  
The ExtendedTestSpider is a Scrapy spider designed to crawl Stack Overflow and save HTML pages. Its objectives include collecting data from Stack Overflow for analysis and research purposes. The next steps for this project could involve extending the spider's functionality to extract specific information from the saved HTML pages, such as question titles, tags, and answers.

**Overview**  
The ExtendedTestSpider utilizes Scrapy, a powerful web crawling framework, to crawl Stack Overflow and save HTML pages. This solution is inspired by the need for a tool to gather data from Stack Overflow for various research and analysis tasks. The proposed system aims to provide a flexible and efficient way to collect data from Stack Overflow for further analysis.

**Design**  
The spider's design allows for the crawling of Stack Overflow pages and the saving of HTML files. It uses Scrapy's built-in features for parsing HTML and following links to crawl multiple pages. The spider's interaction with the Stack Overflow website is governed by the allowed_domains setting, which restricts the crawl to only pages within the specified domain.

**Architecture**  
The software components of the spider include Scrapy, which provides the framework for web crawling, and the spider itself, which is implemented as a Python class. The spider interacts with the Stack Overflow website through HTTP requests and processes the HTML responses to extract and save the relevant content.

**Operation**  
To use the spider, users can specify the start URL, maximum number of pages to crawl, and maximum depth of links to follow. The spider will then crawl Stack Overflow starting from the specified URL and save the HTML pages to a designated folder. Installation involves installing Scrapy and running the spider using the scrapy crawl command.

**Conclusion**  
The ExtendedTestSpider successfully crawls Stack Overflow and saves HTML pages. However, its current implementation is limited to saving HTML files and does not extract specific information from the pages. Future enhancements could include extracting and storing structured data from Stack Overflow, such as question titles, tags, and answers, for more advanced analysis and research tasks.

**Data Sources**  
The data source for the ExtendedTestSpider is Stack Overflow, specifically the questions and answers posted on the website. Users can access Stack Overflow through the allowed_domains setting in the spider to restrict the crawl to this domain. The spider does not require any additional downloads or access information, as it interacts with the publicly available content on Stack Overflow.

**Test Cases**  
For testing the ExtendedTestSpider, a framework like `unittest` in Python can be used. Test cases should cover the following aspects:

1. **Crawl Limit**: Ensure that the spider stops crawling after reaching the specified maximum number of pages.
2. **Depth Limit**: Verify that the spider does not follow links beyond the specified maximum depth.
3. **File Saving**: Test that the spider saves HTML files to the designated folder.
4. **Link Extraction**: Check that the spider extracts and follows links correctly.

**Source Code**  
The source code for the ExtendedTestSpider is provided in the initial code snippet. It is written in Python and uses the Scrapy framework for web crawling. The code is well-documented and includes explanations for each method and its purpose. Dependencies include Scrapy and Python's standard library.
