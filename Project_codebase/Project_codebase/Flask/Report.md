**Abstract (Development summary, objectives, and next steps)**

The Flask-based text query processor presented in this report aims to provide query validation, spelling correction, and query expansion functionalities using NLTK's WordNet. The main objective is to enhance user queries by suggesting corrections and expanding them to include synonyms. This development summary outlines the process of integrating NLTK into a Flask application to achieve these objectives. The next steps involve further refining the query processing algorithms and integrating them with a larger application for real-world usage.

**Overview (Solution outline, relevant literature, proposed system)**

The proposed system utilizes Flask, a lightweight web framework, to create a user-friendly interface for text query processing. Relevant literature on natural language processing and NLTK's capabilities in spelling correction and query expansion guided the design of the system. The solution outline includes using NLTK's WordNet to find synonyms and correct spelling mistakes, enhancing user queries for improved search results.

**Design (System capabilities, interactions, integration)**

The system can process user queries by first correcting spelling errors using NLTK's edit distance algorithm. It then expands the corrected query by finding synonyms using WordNet. These capabilities are integrated into a Flask web application, where users can input their queries and receive the processed results. Interactions with the system are straightforward, requiring users to input their query and specify the number of desired results (k).

**Architecture (Software components, interfaces, implementation)**

The architecture consists of a Flask application that serves as the interface for users. The application utilizes NLTK for spelling correction and query expansion. The implementation involves defining routes for handling user queries and integrating NLTK functions for text processing. The interface is designed to be intuitive, with clear instructions for users on how to input their queries and interpret the results.

**Operation (Software commands, inputs, installation)**

To use the system, users must input their query and specify the number of desired results (k). The system then processes the query, corrects spelling errors, expands the query with synonyms, and returns the results. Installation involves installing Flask and NLTK dependencies, along with downloading NLTK data for word tokenization, spelling correction, and query expansion.

**Conclusion (Success/Failure results, outputs, caveats/cautions)**

The text query processor successfully corrects spelling errors and expands queries using NLTK's WordNet. However, it may not always provide the most relevant results, as WordNet's synsets are based on the English language's lexical relationships. Users should exercise caution when interpreting the results and consider refining their queries for more accurate outcomes. Overall, the system demonstrates the integration of NLTK functionalities into a Flask application for text query processing.
